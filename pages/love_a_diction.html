    <h1>The Language of Love</h1>
    <p>
      Words are indeed powerful.
      When used in the right manner, they can be the most precious art that speaks to the Human Soul.
      Ironically though, words are not the only form to speak the Language of Love.
      In fact, just like languages around the world, there are many variations and dialects of those languages.
      That means that we all have different ways of communicating Love.

    <h2>The 5 Love Languages</h2>
    <p>
      I had no idea how much Gary Chapman's book would have an influence in my life. I interact much better with people due to the level of understanding
      I have now by having read the book. I recognize many more instances in Life when someone is feeling low only because their love tank is feeling low.
      My first instinct is to share this amazing book in hopes that it will have the same effect on them as it did on me. Then I begin by sharing what the
      five primary love languages are and how each one of us have a dominant language, that when "spoken" to us, makes us feel loved -our love tank is full.

    <h2>Love is Divine and Unconditional</h2>
    <p>
      Divine. Unconditional. I know... tough thing to <em>grasp</em>. But that's the thing: we grew up <em>reaching</em> for things.
      For survival, we reached for branches to get to safety. As toddlers, when we want something, we reach for it. We have this internal urge
      to want to reach, and grip on to whatever it is that we desire. This behavior to reach and grasp for things we desire is our attempt to have
      control of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to Love, though, can you ever really have control of the "situation"?
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Yes and No</h3>
    <p>
      Yes: We have control on behalf of our behavior.
      <br>
      No: We are not entirely responsible of how others feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we want to express Love out into the world, we are responsible on the manner in which we do it.
      For example, to express Love as a form of an appreciation letter to a coworker would have completely
      different dynamics -especially interpretations- than merely trying to show appreciation and setting up a romantic dinner for him or her.
      This is why <a href="#">emotional intelligence</a> is required to be able to send the messages in the manner
      we meant to express them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though our actions influence the emotions of others, and after fulfilling our duty of expressing Love
      in the manner we would like to express it in, we are not entirely responsible for what they
      feel. We are not in control of their feelings; they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      This complexity adds meaning to why Love is so Divine and Unconditional.
    </p>

    <h3>Divine</h3>
    <p>
      Love knows no pain. Love is Love. It is Divine... and COMPLETELY in OUR control on behalf of our actions -on our
      mindset and behavior. When we get hurt by others, it is not our Love that becomes damaged, it is our Ego. Our Ego
      seeks protection and refuge, instilling resentment and skepticism, while Love... Love seeks protecting and freedom,
      spreading faith and trust. We all have the capacity to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are all accountable for our own actions, and so if we choose to spread Love, we must choose to be responsible with
      it as well. Just like in <a href="#">Spider-Man</a>, Uncle Ben's famous saying: "With great power, comes great responsibility", Love is
      a powerful force to be responsible with.

<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>
  When it comes to communicating Love, it is more than just words and the expectations of reciprocity.<br>
  There is a saying that tells us to: "Treat others as you would like to be treated", and as much as I love <br>
  the intentional message, the implicit expectations embedded in the message are misleading. <br>
  <br>
  When we treat others using this "rule" as a guide of Loving behavior, we subconsciously implant a false <br>
  belief that the other people we are treating will treat us the same; somewhere along the actions we take, <br>
  we hope they will treat us the same. <br>
  That is not what Love is. It is Divine and Unconditional.



  <h4>The Effect the Golden Rule has on Positive Behavior</h4>
  <p>In a perfect world, somewhere in Utopia, everthing is in perfect order and there is no such thing as <br>
    negativity. Let's be present and realistic, that world is not the world we live in, although it <br>
    still is part of our holistic objective. Plus, we live in an extremely diverse world where our <br>
    certain behaviors are interpreted differently across various cultures. The effect this Golden Rule <br>
    has on Positive Behavior, with people who understand what this rule means, is that each person involved <br>
    in this exchange of positive behavior become uplifted and feel loved. But after a while, this rule becomes <br>
    more like a business transaction rather than intentional message behind this rule. People may begin to feel <br>
    that the only time to be positive is when they are feeling down and need to a "boost" and one day, do not <br>
    get the reciprocated behavior. The person may begin to feel confused, disrespected, or offended by the lack <br>
    of reciprocity. <br>
    The effect of this Golden Rule still has concerning effects even on Positive Behavior.


  </p>


  <h4>The Effect the Golden Rule has on Responding to Negative Behaviors</h4>
  <p>Some of us are strong and wise enough to withstand negative behaviors from others that normally would <br>
    destroy us, but some of us give in easily to infectious behavior, and over time, we don't want to <br>
    treat others with high "expectations" because we don't value ourselves as much anymore. These <br>
    harsh experiences mold us and we become extremely susceptible to going with the drift when Life <br>
    decides to send events that seem to devalue us, but are meant to challenge us. The Golden Rule <br>
    trains the mind to think of every interaction like a selfish transaction rather than a genuine <br>
    relationship. We tend to fall in the cascading mentality of not behaving certain ways because <br>
    we feel we won't get reciprocity. For example, this is a common mindset: "Why should I treat <br>
    them kindly, if they are not going to treat me nice?" <br>
    This shows the effect the Golden Rule has on those with Negative Behaviors; it trains their mind <br>
