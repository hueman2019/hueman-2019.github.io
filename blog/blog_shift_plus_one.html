  <h1>Shift Plus 1</h1>

    <h2>!</h2>
    <p>The beautiful combination of these two keys pressed
      together create a symbol of remarkable grace
      and power. They hold the key to raising the
      tone you use in your head when you find its
      presence in the text you read. They add emphasis
      to the statement.</p>

    <p>This symbol created isn't simply an exclamation
      mark.
      This symbol lives up to its name because it
      encapsulates grace and power to the
      statement that precedes it. </p>

    <p>Wouldn't you like to invigorate your life with this
      kind of grace and power? Would you not rather than
      wake up and view yourself as an aging, rotting human
      being, instead see yourself for what you really are:
      a human being with a beautiful Soul like that of a
      flower's? Where instead of aging, every day you
      grow younger because just like a flower blossoms
      newer petals, you acquire new experiences? </p>
